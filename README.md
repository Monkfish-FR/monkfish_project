This is a composer based installer for the [Monkfish Starter Kit](https://github.com/Monkfish-FR/monkfish_starter) distribution.

# Prerequisites

You may install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) by following the [official instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/). For usage, see [the documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).


# Installation of Monkfish distribution

```
composer create-project Monkfish-FR/monkfish_project MY_PROJECT --no-interaction
```

Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT where you will find the `web` directory with the entire code base of [Monkfish Starter Kit](https://github.com/Monkfish-FR/monkfish_starter).

Then, install this distribution like any other Drupal site.
